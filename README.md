# YoutubePiP
Real YouTube picture-in-picture.

The native YouTube webapp does offer a PiP mode, but this just creates a PiP on the web page.
As of [version 70](https://caniuse.com/#feat=picture-in-picture), Chrome provides [actual PiP](https://developers.google.com/web/updates/2018/10/watch-video-using-picture-in-picture). This extension forces the YouTube webapp to use actual PiP.
